I'm Kevin and I'm a software engineer working for
<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>. I'm currently working on making Docs
more accessible and faster. I live and work in NYC.

I have previously worked for <a href="http://panoramaed.com">Panorama Education</a>,
<a href="http://rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>, and
<a href="http://blackstone.com">The Blackstone Group</a>. I received my BS from
<a href="http://rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>.

I'm fairly active in the open source community with much of my work being associated
with my <a href="https://github.com/kevinoconnor7">Github</a> profile.

# Hi there

I'm Kevin and I'm a staff software engineer working for
[Google](https://google.com), focusing on cross-platform code-sharing infrastructure for Google Workspace. You can find much of my work in [J2CL](https://github.com/google/j2cl), [J2CL Protobuf](https://github.com/google/j2cl-protobuf), and [Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler).

I have previously worked for [Panorama Education](https://panoramaed.com),
[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://union.rpi.edu), and
[The Blackstone Group](https://blackstone.com). I received my BS in Computer Science from
[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu).

I'm fairly active in the open source community with much of my work being associated
with my [Github](https://github.com/kevinoconnor7) profile.

Feel free to e-mail me via `kevin@` the root domain you're visiting this site at. My PGP public key fingerprint is [B66F 8F8C B281 8C18 91AA  C351 4701 2E48 8251 7B3F](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x47012E4882517B3F).
